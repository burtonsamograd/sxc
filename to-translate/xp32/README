README for XP32 Graphics Demo  
-----------------------------

Description:

	XP32 is an MSDOS/VGA based graphics demo.  Running time is about 2 
	minutes.  Effects include gooey plasma-like thing, animated matte
	transistions, 3D vertex rendering, crazy spinning thing, smoke and 
	fire.

Build Requirements:

	Current Version of DJGPP GNU C compiler for MSDOS.
	GNU make for MSDOS.

	These packages are available for free download from ftp.gnu.org in
	/pub/gnu, and oak.oakland.edu in /pub/djgpp (I think).

Build Instructions:

	Extract the source files from the archive (.tar.gz or .zip) into
	an appropriate directory.

	Type 'make' to build the program.

Running Instructions:

	To run this program, you require a program called go32.exe.  This
	is a free DOS extender that is required for the program to run.
	It must be located either in the directory of the executable  or
	the in a directory contained in you system PATH.  go32.exe is
	included in the compiled archive for your convenience.

	This program was originally written in DOS, and to the best
	knowledge of the author, does not run in a Win95 DOS box.  I have
	not tested it in a Win98 DOS box, not have I tested it with the
	newer versions of the go32.exe DOS extender, which may have more
	favorable results.  If you have any problems, try restarting in
	DOS mode and running.

Questions or Comments?:

	Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or comments
	about anything contained in this archive.
