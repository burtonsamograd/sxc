WELL, PRINCE, Genoa and Lucca are now no more than private estates of
the Bonaparte family. No, I warn you, that if you do not tell me we
are at war, if you again allow yourself to palliate all the infamies
and atrocities of this Antichrist (upon my word, I believe he is), I
don't know you in future, you are no longer my friend, no longer my
faithful slave, as you say. There, how do you do, how do you do? I see
I'm scaring you, sit down and talk to me."
